### Question
A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

### Examples
Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
Example 2:

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.

### Constraints
1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105
s consists only of printable ASCII characters.

### Solutions

#### Solution 1: 2 pointers
Don't forget to limit the range when filtering out non-alphabetic and non-numeric characters.

Remember to transform characters to lowercase before comparing.

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        l,r = 0, len(s)-1
        while l<=r:
            while l<r and not s[l].isalnum():
                l += 1
            while l<r and not s[r].isalnum():
                r -= 1
            if s[l].lower()!=s[r].lower():
                return False
            else:
                l += 1
                r -= 1
        return True
