### Question
You are given an m x n integer matrix matrix with the following two properties:

Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false otherwise.

You must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time complexity.


### Examples
Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true


Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false

### Constraints
m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
-104 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 104

### Solutions

#### Solution 1: find the target row first then search within a single row
+ first, find a row where target should be located when it exists
+ then binary search within this row

```
class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        top, bot = 0, len(matrix)-1
        mid_row = 0
        while top<=bot:
            mid_row = (top+bot)//2
            if matrix[mid_row][0]>target:
                bot = mid_row-1
            elif matrix[mid_row][-1]<target:
                top = mid_row+1
            else:
                break
        # if target exist, it shoud be in matrix[mid]
        l, r = 0, len(matrix[0])-1
        while l<=r:
            mid = (l+r)//2
            if matrix[mid_row][mid] ==  target:
                return True
            elif matrix[mid_row][mid]>target:
                r = mid-1
            else:
                l = mid+1
        return False

```
time complexity: O(log(m)+log(n))
space complexity: O(n)
