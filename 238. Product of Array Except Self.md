### Question
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.


### Examples
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
 

### Constraints
2 <= nums.length <= 105
-30 <= nums[i] <= 30
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

### Solutions

#### Solution 1: construct two supplementary arrays to store pre/post products
```
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        pre = [1]
        post = [1]
        # construct pre-product list
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            product = nums[i-1]*pre[i-1]
            pre.append(product)
        for i in range(len(nums)-2,-1,-1):
            # the most recently added element to post is the cumulative product needed for the next round
            product = nums[i+1]*post[-1]
            post.append(product)
        # reverse order for simplicity
        post = post[::-1] 
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            res.append(pre[i]*post[i]) 
        return res
```
time complexity: O(n)
space complexity: O(n)
