### Question
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.


### Examples
Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

### Constraints
0 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

### Solutions

#### Solution 1: find the starting point and increase the consecutive sequence

A very smart solution offered by NeetCode [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6RZZMu_maU]

```
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        num_set = set(nums)
        visited = set()
        max_len = 0
        for num in nums:
            # first find the starting num -- the num without a left neighbor
            if num - 1 not in num_set:
                temp_len = 1
                # increase the sequence length until it's not consecutive anymore
                while num + temp_len not in visited and num+temp_len in num_set:
                    # use extra space to record visited nodes to avoid duplicative visiting
                    visited.add(num+temp_len)
                    temp_len += 1

                max_len = max(max_len, temp_len)
        return max_len

```
time complexity: O(n) 

ps: In my opinion, O(n) is the averaged time complexity because most numbers only appear as a starting number, and only need to be visited once. Plus, we also used an extra set to record the visited node. Without the two conditions mentioned above, the time complexity is more likely to be O(n^2)

space complexity: O(n)


#### Solution 2: topological sort
```
tbc
```
time complexity: O(n)
space complexity: O(n)
