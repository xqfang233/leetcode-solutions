### Question
Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.



### Examples
Example 1:

Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]
Example 3:

Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]

### Constraints
Constraints:

1 <= temperatures.length <= 105
30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100

### Solutions

#### Solution 1: stack
+ initialize the result with a list of 0s of len(temperatures)
+ use a stack to store the highest temperatures&index so far and those temperatures that haven't met a warmer date
+ add the \[temp, ind\] pair to stack while traversing
+ when encounter a new temperature&index, compare with the top element of the stack. If it's a warmer temperature, pop the stack top element and update res. Repeat until the condition is not satisfied anymore or the stack is empty



```
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = [0]*len(temperatures)
        stack = []
        for i,t in enumerate(temperatures):
            while stack and t>stack[-1][0]:
                old_temp, old_ind = stack.pop()
                res[old_ind]=i-old_ind
            stack.append([t,i])
        return res
